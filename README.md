# Typing-Thoughts

This is an implementation of [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.08820) paper on EEG signal classification. 

The aim of this project was is to improve the exisiting architecture for this task. Also, recognition of finer intents is desirable so as to scale the project for real-time systems.

The code for this project is already available [here](https://github.com/xiangzhang1015/Brain_typing). But the implementation of **CNN** is to be improved, as it doesn't contribute a great deal to the overall accuracy of the model.
